# Le Beau Geste (Beta)


This application is for the artists who want to train for gesture quick drawings.
It is basically an image viewer with a timer included to display the next image.

Several applications are already available for this purpose on Windows, but linux is lacking its own one.
This application is a first attempt to fix this problem. If you are using this app, feel welcome to
report issues and suggestions [here](https://github.com/byoso/le_beau_geste/issues).
